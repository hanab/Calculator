# Calculator

# Introduction

The app does basic calculation such as addition , Subtraction, Multiplication, Division , reminder and changing of sign. The decimal (.) functionality in the UI is not implemented. There are Unit and UI tests added to the project. The project  is done using Swift language for iOS platform(for iOS device or simulator with iOS 13.0 or later) 

The application also shows the latest 10 calculation in a table view above the calculator , I placed the table view above the calculator because I think it looks better. I am using Coredata for persistent storage.
